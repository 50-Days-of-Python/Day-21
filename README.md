### Capitalize First Letter
Write a function called capitalize. This function takes a string as an argument and capitalizes the first letter of each word.   
For example, `‘i like learning’` becomes `‘I Like Learning’`.

## Extra Challenge  

### Reversed List  
`str1 = 'leArning is hard, bUt if You appLy youRself you can achieVe success'`  
You are given a string of words. Some of the words in the string contain uppercase letters. Write a code that will return all the words that have an uppercase letter. Your code should return a list of the words. Each word in the list should be reversed. Here is how your output should look:  
`['gninrAel', 'tUb', 'uoY', 'yLppa', 'flesRuoy', 'eVeihca']`

## :scroll:Steps To Complete the assignment
**Step 1:** Write the program as per the question in any online or local compiler.  
**Step 2:** Come back here and paste the code in the `main.py`:apple: file and commit the changes.  
**Step 3:** If you want you can go and do extra.py also(It won't add any points on main.py has points)  
**Step 4:** After committing your changes you can check if your program passed all the test-cases or not in the `Actions`:green_apple: Tab.
